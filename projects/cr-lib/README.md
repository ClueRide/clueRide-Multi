# Clue Ride Library - Shared code across all apps

This code base is compiled and then shared with all other apps. Any code 
that is shared between any two apps should be placed into this part of the repo.

This is an Ionic 4 code base supporting iOS and Android mobile devices. It is also 
possible to build desktop webapps from this same code base.
