# Clue Ride Course Editor
This app allows a Guide to prepare Courses that connect Attractions
from a start to an end -- which may be the same as the start.

Attractions are created and edited in the field using a separate app
called the Location Editor MobiLoc.

This is an Ionic 4 application supported for iOS and Android 
mobile devices but will generally be used as a desktop webapp to allow better
keyboard access and increased screen space for maps and side-by-side lists.
