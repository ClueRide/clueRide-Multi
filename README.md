# Clue Ride - Multi-App
Clue Ride appears to be a scavenger hunt, but it's actually community-building 
in disguise. 

Clue Ride started as a family game solving puzzles where each solution revealed the 
location of the next clue. As we grew up, the game moved into the LIT lanes 
(LIT = Light Individual Transportation). 

Seekers turn into Sleuths by earning their wings: running the courses, solving clues, and 
adding their own puzzles along the way.

You can learn more about the game at https://clueride.com.

The suite of front-end applications has been brought into a single repo with this iteration that 
also upgrades from Ionic 3 to Ionic 4. The various Clue Ride servers still have their code 
in separate repos.
